***command line edition!***   

Animal Crossing: New Leaf's in-game soundtrack plays according to time of day and weather (default/clear, rainy, or snowy), with special songs for holidays and other special events.

This python program plays the soundtrack according to these attributes - just like you would hear in the game!
