***command line edition!***   

Animal Crossing: New Leaf's in-game soundtrack plays according to time of day and weather (default/clear, rainy, or snowy), with special songs for holidays and other special events.

This python program plays the soundtrack according to these attributes - just like you would hear in the game!

## Setup
`git clone https://github.com/hollyt/ac-nl-player-cl`   
This program uses `mplayer` as the default music program. If you use something different, change `line 35` accordingly.   
You will also need a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/appid). Add your API key to `line 4`.
